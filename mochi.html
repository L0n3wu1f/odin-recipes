        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1 cup sweetened red bean paste</li>
            <li>1 cup glutinous rice flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon matcha</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup cornstarch</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Wrap red bean paste in aluminum foil and place in the freezer until solid, at least 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Mix rice flour and matcha in a microwavable bowl. Stir in water and sugar; mix until smooth.</li>
            <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and microwave for 3.5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove bean paste from the freezer and divide into 8 equal balls and set aside.</li>

            <li>Dust a work area with the cornstarch. Roll about 2 tablespoons of hot rice flour mixture into a ball. Flatten the ball and place one ball of frozen bean paste in the center. Pinch and press the dough around the bean paste until completely covered. Sprinkle with additional cornstarch and place mochi, seam-side down, in a paper muffin liner to prevent sticking.</li>
