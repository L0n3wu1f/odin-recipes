        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Onigiri are a Japanese snack, a delicious alternative to an American sandwich. Rice shaped in triangles or balls fill with whatever suits your fancy. Most are commonly filled with pickled plums or salmon, but anything will really do. (Must be refrigerated)</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>2 cups water</li>
                <li>1 cup jasmine or sushi rice</li>
                <li>salt</li>
                <li>1 sheet nori(dried seaweed), cut into 1-inch strips or as desired.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Combine 2 cups water, rice, and a pinch of salt in a saucepan. Bring to a boil then reduce the heat to a medium-low and cover. Simmer, stirring occasionally to prevent rice from sticking, until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed. Roughly 20-25 minutes. Fluff with a fork and cool rice until it is easily handled, roughly 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Fill a small bowl with water, place 2 tablesoons of salt in another small bowl.</li>
                <li>Dip hands in water and rub salt over hands to prevent rice from sticking. Take a handful of warm rice and form it into a ball. Gently squish ball; with your hands in an "L" or "C" shape, apply gentle pressure to the sides to make a triangle shape.</li>
                <li>Wrap a strip of nori around the triangle, using a bit of water to help it stick if necessary.</li>
                <li><em>Enjoy!</em></li>
            </ol>
